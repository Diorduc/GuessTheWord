1. Player Name and High Scores:
Implement a system to store and display the names and high scores of players. This will allow players to compete with each other and try to achieve the highest score.

2. Random Word List from Chosen Domain:
Instead of a fixed word list, allow the player to choose a specific domain (e.g., animals, countries, fruits) from which the game will generate a random word list. This will add variety and customization to the game.

3. Save and Load Game Progress:
Add functionality to save the current game progress (including player name, score, and remaining lives) to a file. Also, allow the player to load a previously saved game and resume playing from where they left off.

4. Difficulty Levels:
Introduce different difficulty levels (e.g., beginner, intermediate, expert) that modify the game's mechanics. For example, in the expert level, the player may have fewer lives or face a larger word list.

5. Timer and Time-Based Scoring:
Include a timer for each word guess, and award bonus points based on how quickly the player guesses the word. This adds an element of time pressure and encourages faster thinking.

6. Hint System:
Implement a hint system that allows the player to get a clue about the word they are trying to guess. Using hints may cost the player some points, so they must use them wisely.

7. User Interface Improvements:
Enhance the user interface with graphics, colors, and animations to make the game visually appealing and engaging.

8. Multiple Players and Multiplayer Mode:
Allow multiple players to take turns playing the game on the same device or implement a multiplayer mode that enables players to compete against each other online.

9. Word Database Expansion:
Increase the size of the word database to include more words and categories, making the game more challenging and enjoyable.

10. Sound Effects and Music:
Add sound effects and background music to enhance the gaming experience.

11. Achievements and Rewards:
Introduce achievements or rewards that players can unlock based on their in-game accomplishments, such as reaching a certain score, guessing multiple words correctly in a row, or completing the game on different difficulty levels.
